# Skill Catalog (Unified)

This catalog is the single discovery layer for **all skills and plugins** across OpenCode, openclaw, and n8n. It is **readable by humans and agents** and should be updated whenever a skill is published or updated.

> Lifecycle currently stops at **MAINTAIN** (no deprecation phase).

## Notes

- **Owner is required**. If unowned, default to Julian.
- **Blast radius drives approvals** (low/medium self-publish, high needs explicit approval).
- **permissions/data_categories/egress** are mandatory for medium/high skills.
- Keep entries concise and consistent. This file is a registry, not a full spec.
- For skills that read command docs, use installed paths in `SKILL.md`: `${AGENTS_SKILLS_ROOT}/<skill-name>/commands/<file-name>.md`.
