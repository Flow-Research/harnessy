# .jarvis/context/ — Knowledge Base Protocol

## Purpose

This directory is the canonical knowledge base for the Flow Network workspace. AI agents, Jarvis CLI, and human contributors read these files for project context.

## Loading Order

For **general context**, read in this order:
1. `projects.md` — What exists, where it lives, current status
2. `focus.md` — What we're actively working on right now
3. `priorities.md` — Priority ordering when conflicts arise
4. `goals.md` — Current sprint and phase goals

For **architecture/design** tasks, also read:
5. `decisions.md` — Settled architectural decisions
6. `docs/flow-poc-architecture.md` — Current POC system architecture
7. `docs/flow-deep-system-analysis.md` — Strategic analysis of the full vision

For **development** tasks, also read:
8. `patterns.md` — Code patterns and conventions
9. `preferences.md` — Tool and library preferences
10. `constraints.md` — Technical limits and performance targets
11. `blockers.md` — Current blockers and tech debt

For **planning/scheduling**, also read:
12. `calendar.md` — Milestones and timeline
13. `recurring.md` — Recurring tasks and rituals
14. `delegation.md` — Team structure and delegation candidates

For **meeting context**, browse:
15. `meetings/PROTOCOL.md` — Meeting notes template and naming convention
16. `meetings/YYYY/Mon/DD-<title>.md` — Individual meeting notes (most recent first)

## Template Syntax

Files may start with `{{global}}`. This is a **Jarvis CLI feature** that includes global context from `~/.jarvis/context/`. Other agents should treat `{{global}}` as a no-op marker and read the rest of the file normally.

## Tiers

- **Workspace-level** (this directory): Covers the full Flow Network workspace
- **Project-level** (e.g. `Flow/.jarvis/context/`): Project-specific overrides; same file structure
- Project-level files take precedence when working within a specific sub-project

## Freshness Convention

The `Updated` column in the catalog tracks when each file was last meaningfully updated. Files older than 2 months should be reviewed before relying on them for current decisions.
