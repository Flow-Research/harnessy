# .jarvis/context/ — Knowledge Base Protocol

## Purpose

This directory is the canonical knowledge base for the Flow Network workspace. AI agents, Jarvis CLI, and human contributors read these files for project context.

## Loading Order

For **general context**, read in this order:
1. `status.md` — Active work and current execution truth
2. `roadmap.md` — Phase ordering, milestones, and what is deferred
3. `team.md` — Ownership, delegation, and coordination model
4. `technical-debt.md` — Current debt register and cleanup obligations

Optional supporting docs when relevant:
5. `projects.md` — Workspace inventory, paths, and project roles
6. `decisions.md` — Settled architectural and economic decisions

For **architecture/design** tasks, also read:
7. `docs/flow-poc-architecture.md` — Current POC system architecture
8. `docs/flow-deep-system-analysis.md` — Reference analysis of the broader Flow vision

For **development** tasks, also read:
9. `docs/standards/development-guidance.md` — Workspace engineering workflow guidance

For **meeting context**, browse:
10. `meetings/PROTOCOL.md` — Meeting notes template and naming convention
11. `meetings/YYYY/Mon/DD-<title>.md` — Individual meeting notes (most recent first)

## Template Syntax

Files may start with `{{global}}`. This is a **Jarvis CLI feature** that includes global context from `~/.jarvis/context/`. Other agents should treat `{{global}}` as a no-op marker and read the rest of the file normally.

## Tiers

- **Workspace-level** (this directory): Shared Flow Network truth
- **Project-level** (e.g. `Flow/.jarvis/context/`): Project-specific overrides and implementation details
- Project-level files take precedence when working inside a specific sub-project

## Freshness Convention

The `Updated` column in the catalog tracks when each file was last meaningfully updated. Files older than 2 months should be reviewed before relying on them for current decisions.
