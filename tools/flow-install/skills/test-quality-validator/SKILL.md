# Test Quality Validator

## Purpose

Validate that generated or maintained tests are complete, trustworthy, and aligned with approved specs and regression artifacts.

## Required contract

- spec root from the active spec-root contract
- regression artifact paths from `.flow/delivery-profile.json`
- role inventory and validator rules from `.flow/delivery-profile.json`

- Template paths are resolved from `${AGENTS_SKILLS_ROOT}/test-quality-validator/`.

## Checks

1. Coverage completeness against acceptance criteria and regression scenarios.
2. False-green risk detection in generated or hand-written suites.
3. Pattern adherence against delivery-profile-configured validator rules.
4. Role and authorization coverage.

## Steps

1. Parse criteria with `${AGENTS_SKILLS_ROOT}/spec-to-regression/scripts/extract-criteria.ts`.
2. Parse API regression scenarios with `${AGENTS_SKILLS_ROOT}/api-integration-codegen/scripts/parse-api-regression.ts`.
3. Run `${AGENTS_SKILLS_ROOT}/test-quality-validator/scripts/validate-coverage.ts` with the optional delivery profile.
4. Run `${AGENTS_SKILLS_ROOT}/test-quality-validator/scripts/validate-correctness.ts` against the project's browser/API suites with the optional delivery profile.
5. Synthesize the results into a single quality report.

## Decision Trace Protocol

This skill participates in the skill evolution system by capturing decision traces at gate resolutions and consulting accumulated feedback.

### Trace Consultation (short loop)

Before executing any step with a quality or human gate, query accumulated decision traces:

```bash
python3 "${AGENTS_SKILLS_ROOT}/_shared/trace_query.py" recent \
    --skill "test-quality-validator" --gate "<gate_name>" --limit 5 --min-loops 1
```

If patterns or recent feedback exist, incorporate them as additional constraints. Do not cite traces to the user unless asked.

### Trace Capture (after gate resolution)

After every gate resolves, capture a decision trace:

```bash
python3 "${AGENTS_SKILLS_ROOT}/_shared/trace_capture.py" capture \
    --skill "test-quality-validator" \
    --gate "<gate_name>" --gate-type "<human|quality>" \
    --outcome "<approved|rejected|passed|failed>" \
    --refinement-loops <N> \
    [--feedback "<user's feedback text>"] \
    [--category <CATEGORY>]
```

### Post-Run Retrospective

After completion, ask: **"Any feedback on this test-quality-validator run? (skip to finish)"**
If provided, capture via trace_capture.py with gate "run_retrospective" and gate-type "retrospective".

## Output

- quality report with coverage %, false-green risks, pattern violations, and role coverage gaps
- explicit failures and warnings suitable for PR review or CI gating
