# Context Sync Command

Provide a deterministic repository sync flow for both technical and non-technical users.

Primary user intents:
1) `pull`: safely update the current branch from a selected remote branch.
2) `push`: safely publish local changes, create or reuse a PR, and keep working until the PR reaches a terminal success state or an explicit safe escalation state.

Default target branch is the repository integration branch from `.flow/delivery-profile.json` when present; otherwise fall back to `dev`.

When running inside an issue-flow worktree, context-sync auto-detects the issue context and adjusts defaults — pulling/pushing against the issue's base branch instead of the integration branch, enriching commit messages with the issue reference, and handling state file conflicts interactively.

Legacy compatibility:
- `sync` remains supported as an alias for `push`.
- Prefer `pull` and `push` in summaries, examples, and help text.

## User Request

$ARGUMENTS

## Safety Invariants

These rules are mandatory.

1. Never force push.
2. Never push local work directly to protected branches such as `main` or the active integration branch.
3. Never use destructive cleanup commands such as `git reset --hard`, `git checkout --`, or `git clean -fd`.
4. Never auto-stage everything with `git add -A`.
5. Never auto-commit secret candidates, ignored files, unknown binaries, or files outside the eligible change set.
6. Never continue if Git is already in the middle of a merge, rebase, cherry-pick, revert, or bisect.
7. Never silently discard local changes. If a stash is created, report it and either restore it or stop with recovery guidance.
8. Never leave a failed PR unattended after `push`. Either the autonomous PR-resolution loop starts successfully, or the command ends in an explicit safe escalation state.
9. Never claim success without fresh verification evidence.
10. Never merge a PR. Never ask to merge a PR. Never offer to merge. The push flow creates or updates a PR, monitors CI, and reports readiness. Merging is always the user's own action outside of context-sync.

## Mode Semantics

- `status`: local-only analysis. Do not run `git fetch`. Do not write to the working tree, index, refs, or `.git/context-sync/`.
- `plan`: local-only planning. Do not run `git fetch`. Do not write to the working tree, index, refs, or `.git/context-sync/`.
- `pull`: write-capable sync. Network and git-history changes are allowed only after preflight passes.
- `push`: write-capable publish flow. Network, branch creation, commit creation, PR creation, and the bounded PR-resolution loop are allowed only after preflight passes.
- `sync`: treat as `push`.

If no subcommand is provided:
- default to `pull`
- report that default explicitly in the summary

## Persistent Run Ledger

`push` creates or resumes a deterministic run ledger inside:

```text
.git/context-sync/runs/<sanitized-push-branch>.json
```

Sanitize the branch name deterministically before using it as a filename:
- lowercase the branch name
- replace `/` with `__`
- replace any remaining non `[a-z0-9._-]` characters with `_`
- append `.json`

Example:

```text
feat/api/refactor-auth -> .git/context-sync/runs/feat__api__refactor-auth.json
```

The ledger must capture at minimum:
- `run_id`
- `intent`
- `target_remote`
- `target_branch`
- `push_remote`
- `push_branch`
- `protected_branch_guard`
- `created_safety_branch`
- `pr_number`
- `pr_url`
- `loop_state`
- `last_blocker`
- `last_ci_run_id`
- `autonomous_attempts`
- `last_fix_commit`
- `terminal_status`
- `terminal_reason`

Determinism rules:
- Reuse the existing ledger when the same branch already has an active non-terminal run.
- Reuse the existing PR when the same `head` and `base` already map to an open PR.
- Reuse the same safety branch if the ledger already created one for the current run.

`status` and `plan` must not create or mutate the ledger.

## Branch And Remote Resolution

Resolve the target in this order:

1. If the user passed `--remote` and `--branch`, use them.
2. Else if the user referenced a branch in natural language or command arguments, use that branch with `origin` unless a remote was explicitly provided.
3. Else default to:

```text
TARGET_REMOTE=origin
TARGET_BRANCH=<integration-branch>
```

Resolve the current branch:

```bash
git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD
```

If the result is `HEAD`, abort with guidance to check out a branch first.

Resolve the push source branch:

```bash
git rev-parse --abbrev-ref --symbolic-full-name "@{u}"
```

If upstream exists:
- `PUSH_REMOTE` and `PUSH_BRANCH` come from upstream.

Resolve the GitHub PR repository for `push` operations in this order:
1. If upstream exists, use the upstream remote URL.
2. Else use `TARGET_REMOTE`.
3. Normalize that remote to a GitHub repo slug and store it as `PR_REPO=<owner>/<repo>`.

All `gh pr *` commands in `push` and the PR-resolution loop must pass:

```text
-R "$PR_REPO"
```

If upstream does not exist:
- `PUSH_REMOTE=origin`
- `PUSH_BRANCH=<current-branch>`
- allow upstream creation later during `push`

Protected branch guard:
- Protected branches are `main` and `dev`.
- If `push` or `sync` is invoked while `PUSH_BRANCH` is protected and local work would be published, create or reuse a deterministic safety branch:

```text
SAFE_BRANCH=sync/<current-branch>
```

- Prefer reusing `SAFE_BRANCH` if it already exists locally or in the run ledger.
- Never generate timestamp-only branch names for the same logical run unless the prior safety branch is unusable and that reason is recorded in the ledger.

## Issue-Flow Context Detection

After resolving the branch and remote, detect whether this checkout is an active issue-flow worktree. This is a non-blocking enrichment step — issue-flow absence is never a blocker.

### Detection steps

1. Check if this is a linked worktree:

```bash
COMMON_DIR=$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)
GIT_DIR=$(git rev-parse --git-dir)
```

If `COMMON_DIR != GIT_DIR`, set `IS_WORKTREE=true`.

2. Search for a matching `.issue-flow-state.json`. Resolve the spec root in this order:
   - `BUILD_E2E_SPEC_ROOT` environment variable (if set)
   - `.jarvis/context/specs/` (if exists)
   - `specs/` (if exists)

   Search all subdirectories of the spec root for `.issue-flow-state.json` files. For each found file, read the JSON and check if `git.branch` matches the current branch name.

3. If no state file matched but the current branch matches the pattern `<digits>_<slug>` (e.g., `113_program-team-selection`), set as a soft signal. This adjusts the target branch default to `dev` but does not activate full issue-flow awareness (no issue number, no commit enrichment).

4. Store the result as `ISSUE_FLOW_CONTEXT`:

```text
active: <true if state file found and matched, false otherwise>
issue_number: <from state.issue.number, or null>
issue_url: <from state.issue.url, or null>
base_branch: <from state.git.base_branch, or "dev" for soft signal>
phase_id: <from state.phase.id, or null>
phase_name: <from state.phase.name, or null>
state_file_path: <relative path to matched state file, or null>
is_worktree: <true if linked worktree>
```

Read only these fields from the state file: `issue.number`, `issue.url`, `git.branch`, `git.base_branch`, `phase.id`, `phase.name`. Do not depend on other fields.

### Target branch override

When `ISSUE_FLOW_CONTEXT.active` is true (or soft signal matched) and the user did NOT pass an explicit `--branch`:
- Override `TARGET_BRANCH` to `ISSUE_FLOW_CONTEXT.base_branch`
- Log: `"Issue-flow detected (#<number>, Phase <id>). Target branch: <base_branch>"`
- For soft signal: `"Issue-flow branch pattern detected. Target branch: dev"`

This override applies to both `pull` and `push` flows. It ensures the issue branch rebases from and targets its actual base branch, not the integration branch — minimizing conflicts from unrelated work.

The user can always override with `--branch <name>`.

## Preflight Blockers

Before checking blockers, run the shared dependency validator:

```bash
bash "${AGENTS_SKILLS_ROOT}/_shared/check-dependencies.sh" \
    --manifest "${AGENTS_SKILLS_ROOT}/context-sync/manifest.yaml"
```

If any required dependency is missing (e.g., `gh`, `git`), report the missing tools with their platform-specific install commands and ask the user's permission to install. If `gh` is missing and the user declines, warn that PR operations will be unavailable but allow `pull` and `status` to proceed.

Abort before any write operation when any of the following is true:
- not a git repository
- detached HEAD
- missing remote
- missing target branch for `pull`
- ongoing merge, rebase, cherry-pick, revert, or bisect
- unmerged entries in the index
- missing `gh` CLI for `push` (after dependency check offered installation)
- missing GitHub authentication for PR operations in `push`
- missing local verification tooling required by the configured verification profile

Suggested Git checks:

```bash
git rev-parse --show-toplevel
git rev-parse --git-common-dir
git rev-parse --git-dir
git status --porcelain -uall
git ls-files -u
git rev-parse --git-path MERGE_HEAD
git rev-parse --git-path CHERRY_PICK_HEAD
git rev-parse --git-path REVERT_HEAD
git rev-parse --git-path rebase-merge
git rev-parse --git-path rebase-apply
git rev-parse --git-path BISECT_LOG
git remote get-url "$TARGET_REMOTE"
gh auth status
```

If any blocker is present, stop with:
- `status=aborted`
- `failed_step=preflight`
- `abort_reason=<specific reason>`
- 1-3 recovery commands

## Eligible Change Set

Build the eligible publish set deterministically.

Tracked changes:

```bash
git diff --name-only
git diff --cached --name-only
```

Untracked non-ignored files:

```bash
git ls-files --others --exclude-standard
```

Never auto-stage files matching secret or credential patterns, including:
- `.env`
- `.env.*`
- `*.pem`
- `*.key`
- `*.p12`
- `*.pfx`
- `id_rsa`
- `id_ed25519`
- `credentials.json`
- files whose basename contains `secret`, `token`, `credential`, or `private`

Never auto-stage ignored files.

Never auto-stage binary files. Determine binary status with a deterministic check, for example by requiring the file to be UTF-8 decodable text or to match the allowed-text-extension list below.

If any forbidden candidate exists in the working tree, abort before staging and report the exact files.

Eligible untracked files may be auto-staged only if they match this allowlist exactly:
- `*.ts`, `*.tsx`, `*.js`, `*.jsx`, `*.mjs`, `*.cjs`
- `*.py`, `*.rb`, `*.go`, `*.rs`, `*.java`, `*.kt`, `*.swift`, `*.php`
- `*.json`, `*.yaml`, `*.yml`, `*.toml`, `*.md`, `*.txt`, `*.sh`

If the untracked set contains anything else, abort with a safe-review message instead of guessing.

## Verification Profile

Use the repository verification profile before any publish attempt.

Default profile for this repository:

```bash
pnpm skills:validate && pnpm turbo lint && pnpm turbo test && pnpm turbo build --filter='!coach'
```

Rules:
- Run verification after the branch-sync step and before any push.
- If verification fails, stop before push.
- If the PR-resolution loop makes an autonomous fix, rerun the full profile before the next push.
- Record every verification command and outcome in the ledger and final summary.

## Status Flow

Run local-only analysis and report:
- current branch
- target remote and branch
- push remote and branch
- whether a safety branch would be required
- whether a ledger already exists for this branch
- eligible tracked change count
- eligible untracked change count
- forbidden candidate count
- whether the branch has an upstream
- whether local blockers exist
- issue-flow context status:
  - if active: issue number, phase, base branch, target override
  - if worktree detected but no state file: `inactive`
  - if neither: `not_detected`

Do not run `git fetch`.
Do not create or modify the ledger.

## Plan Flow

Run the same local-only analysis as `status`, then print the exact ordered command plan that `pull` or `push` would execute from the current local state.

Rules:
- Base the plan on local refs only.
- If remote freshness is unknown, say so explicitly instead of fetching.
- Do not create or modify the ledger.

## Pull Flow

Use this flow when the user wants the latest remote changes locally.

1. Run preflight.
2. Resolve the remote branch exists:

```bash
git ls-remote --heads "$TARGET_REMOTE" "$TARGET_BRANCH"
```

3. If the working tree is dirty, create a named temporary stash that includes untracked files:

```bash
STASH_NAME="context-sync-autostash"
git stash push -u -m "$STASH_NAME"
```

4. Rebase only onto the selected target branch. Do not rebase through `main -> dev -> target` chains by default.

```bash
git fetch "$TARGET_REMOTE" "$TARGET_BRANCH"
git rebase "$TARGET_REMOTE/$TARGET_BRANCH"
```

5. If a stash was created, restore it only after the rebase succeeds:

```bash
git stash pop "stash^{/$STASH_NAME}"
```

6. On rebase conflict:
   a. Check which files are in conflict:

   ```bash
   git diff --name-only --diff-filter=U
   ```

   b. If `ISSUE_FLOW_CONTEXT.active` is true and ALL conflicting files match `**/.issue-flow-state.json` (no other files in conflict):
      - Pause and present the user with a choice:

      ```text
      Rebase conflict in .issue-flow-state.json

      This is the issue-flow state file — it tracks your issue's progress.
      The remote branch has a different version. How would you like to resolve?

        1. Keep mine (recommended) — Keep your local state. Issue-flow will
           reconcile automatically on its next run.
        2. Accept theirs — Use the remote version. Your local progress
           markers may need re-verification.
        3. Abort rebase — Cancel the pull entirely. No changes made.
      ```

      - After user chooses:
        - Option 1: `git checkout --ours <files> && git add <files> && git rebase --continue`
        - Option 2: `git checkout --theirs <files> && git add <files> && git rebase --continue`
        - Option 3: `git rebase --abort`, restore stash if applicable, stop

   c. If ANY non-state-file is also in conflict, or if issue-flow context is not active: run `git rebase --abort`, preserve the stash, and stop with recovery guidance.

7. On stash-restore conflict, keep the rebased branch intact, report conflicting files, and stop.

Return a concise summary with:
- pulled from `<TARGET_REMOTE>/<TARGET_BRANCH>`
- whether local work remains dirty
- whether a stash was created and restored

## Push Flow

Use this flow when the user wants to publish local changes and keep the PR moving until it resolves or safely escalates.

### Step 1: Run preflight and create or resume the ledger

- Run preflight.
- Resolve or create the deterministic ledger for this branch.
- If a safety branch is required, switch to it before any publish action and update the ledger.

### Step 2: Protect local changes if needed

If the working tree is dirty before branch sync, create a deterministic temporary stash:

```bash
STASH_NAME="context-sync-autostash"
git stash push -u -m "$STASH_NAME"
```

### Step 3: Sync with the current working branch remote

First check if the push branch exists remotely:

```bash
git ls-remote --heads "$PUSH_REMOTE" "$PUSH_BRANCH"
```

If the push branch exists remotely and is not protected:

```bash
git pull --rebase "$PUSH_REMOTE" "$PUSH_BRANCH"
```

If the push branch does not exist remotely (e.g., it was deleted after a PR merge), skip this step entirely and continue. The branch will be created fresh on push with `-u`.

If the branch-sync step conflicts:
- run `git rebase --abort`
- **immediately restore the stash** if one was created (do not leave changes stuck in stash)
- stop before staging or pushing

**Safety rule**: Steps 2 (stash), 3 (sync), and 4 (restore) must each be executed as separate operations. Never chain them in a single command — if sync fails after stashing, the stash must be restored before reporting the error.

### Step 3b: Rebase against target branch

After syncing with the remote working branch, rebase onto the target branch to ensure the eventual PR will be conflict-free:

```bash
git fetch "$TARGET_REMOTE" "$TARGET_BRANCH"
git rebase "$TARGET_REMOTE/$TARGET_BRANCH"
```

If the rebase succeeds, the branch is now ahead of the target branch with no conflicts. Continue to Step 4.

If the rebase conflicts:

1. Check if ALL conflicting files are `.issue-flow-state.json` AND `ISSUE_FLOW_CONTEXT.active` is true:
   - Resolve with `--ours` (keep local state — issue-flow reconciliation will handle it automatically):
     ```bash
     git checkout --ours <conflicting-state-files>
     git add <conflicting-state-files>
     git rebase --continue
     ```
   - Repeat for each rebase step that conflicts on state files only.

2. For any other conflicting files:
   - If the file was only added on the target branch (not modified locally), accept theirs:
     ```bash
     git checkout --theirs <file>
     git add <file>
     git rebase --continue
     ```
   - If the file was modified on both sides, attempt auto-merge resolution. If git can resolve the markers automatically, stage and continue.
   - If any file cannot be resolved automatically, abort the rebase, restore the stash if one was created, and stop with recovery guidance explaining which files conflict and what the user should do.

If the target branch does not exist on the remote (e.g., `dev` was specified but doesn't exist), skip this step.

### Step 4: Restore the stash if one was created

Restore it only after the branch-sync step succeeds:

```bash
git stash pop "stash^{/$STASH_NAME}"
```

If stash restore conflicts, stop before staging or pushing.

### Step 5: Compute and stage only the eligible change set

Never use `git add -A`.

Stage tracked changes with:

```bash
git add -u -- <eligible-tracked-files>
```

Stage eligible untracked text files with:

```bash
git add -- <eligible-untracked-files>
```

If no eligible staged changes remain after filtering:
- if an open PR already exists for this branch, set `PUBLISH_MODE=noop_pr_only`, skip commit creation, skip `git push`, and continue directly to PR management for the existing PR
- otherwise stop with `status=aborted`, `failed_step=staging`, and `abort_reason=no_eligible_publishable_changes`

### Step 6: Verify locally

Run the configured verification profile.

If verification fails:
- stop before commit and push
- record the blocker in the ledger
- return `status=aborted`

### Step 7: Create the commit if needed

Collect staged metadata:

```bash
git diff --cached --name-only
git diff --cached --numstat -M
git diff --cached --name-status -M
git diff --cached --shortstat
```

Build a conventional commit message with fixed type and scope:

```text
chore(sync): <deterministic subject>
```

Subject algorithm:
- if every staged file is under `.agents/skills/context-sync/`, use `chore(sync): update context-sync workflow`
- else if every staged file is docs-like (`*.md`, `*.txt`), use `chore(sync): update repository documentation`
- else if every staged file is config-like (`*.json`, `*.yaml`, `*.yml`, `*.toml`, `package.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `turbo.json`), use `chore(sync): update repository configuration`
- else use `chore(sync): update repository changes`

Do not invent a more specific subject unless the staged-file pattern matches one of the rules above exactly.

Issue reference: when `ISSUE_FLOW_CONTEXT.active` is true and `issue_number` is available, append `(#<issue_number>)` to the subject. Example: `chore(sync): update repository changes (#123)`. This creates a GitHub auto-link to the issue.

Create the commit only when staged changes exist:

```bash
git commit -m "<subject>" -m "<body>"
```

### Step 8: Push the branch

If `PUBLISH_MODE=noop_pr_only`, skip branch push entirely and record `push=skipped`.

If upstream already exists:

```bash
git push "$PUSH_REMOTE" "$PUSH_BRANCH"
```

If upstream does not exist:

```bash
git push -u "$PUSH_REMOTE" "$PUSH_BRANCH"
```

Do not rerun the entire push flow automatically just to confirm upstream. Upstream creation is complete once `git push -u` succeeds.

### Step 9: Create or reuse the PR deterministically

Let:
- `PR_BASE=$TARGET_BRANCH`
- `PR_HEAD=$PUSH_BRANCH`

If `PR_HEAD == PR_BASE`, skip PR creation and stop with `pr=skipped_already_on_target`.

Look for an existing open PR first:

```bash
gh pr list -R "$PR_REPO" --state open --head "$PR_HEAD" --base "$PR_BASE" --json number,url,state,isDraft
```

If an open PR exists for the same `head` and `base`:
- reuse it
- record `pr=updated_existing`

If no open PR exists, create one:

```bash
gh pr create -R "$PR_REPO" --base "$PR_BASE" --head "$PR_HEAD" --fill
```

When creating a new PR and `ISSUE_FLOW_CONTEXT.active` is true with `issue_number` available, append `Closes #<issue_number>` to the PR body using `--body` or by amending after `--fill`. Do not add this when reusing an existing PR.

If PR creation fails, stop with `pr=creation_failed` and keep the branch pushed.

## PR Resolution Loop

After `push` creates or reuses a PR, the workflow must attach a bounded autonomous PR-resolution loop.

This loop may run inline if resolution is immediate, or as a durable background task if the PR requires waiting on CI or review.

### Loop Contract

The loop owns the branch and PR until one of these terminal states occurs:
- `ready_to_merge`
- `closed_by_user`
- `escalated_manual_review`
- `retry_budget_exhausted`
- `auth_or_permission_lost`
- `unsafe_change_required`

If the loop cannot start successfully, `push` is not complete. Report that as an escalation, not a success.

### Autonomous Scope

The loop may handle only clearly mechanical blockers by default:
- failed lint
- failed format or generated-file drift
- deterministic CI config issues
- deterministic test failures that can be fixed confidently and verified locally
- stale branch that needs a safe rebase with no conflicts

The loop must escalate instead of guessing when it encounters:
- requested changes with ambiguous product intent
- security-sensitive diffs
- large refactors
- merge conflicts requiring judgment
- contradictory review comments
- repeated non-deterministic failures

### Retry Budget

Use bounded retries:

```text
MAX_AUTONOMOUS_ATTEMPTS=5
MAX_REPEATED_BLOCKER_ATTEMPTS=3
```

Rules:
- increment `autonomous_attempts` only when the loop creates a new fix commit or a new rebase/push attempt
- if the same blocker signature repeats 3 times, escalate
- if total autonomous attempts reaches 5 without terminal success, escalate

### Loop Steps

1. Observe PR state and latest checks:

```bash
gh pr view -R "$PR_REPO" <number> --json number,url,state,mergeStateStatus,reviewDecision,statusCheckRollup,isDraft
```

2. Classify the current blocker as one of:
- `waiting_for_ci`
- `mechanical_ci_failure`
- `waiting_for_review`
- `requested_changes_ambiguous`
- `merge_conflict`
- `ready_to_merge`
- `closed`

3. Act by blocker class:
- `waiting_for_ci`: keep watching
- `mechanical_ci_failure`: create or resume a fix task, apply the fix, rerun full local verification, push, then loop
- `waiting_for_review`: keep watching until review changes state or an SLA threshold is hit; do not spam commits
- `requested_changes_ambiguous`: escalate safely
- `merge_conflict`: rebase the working branch onto the target branch to resolve:
  1. Fetch the latest target branch: `git fetch origin <TARGET_BRANCH>`
  2. Rebase: `git rebase origin/<TARGET_BRANCH>`
  3. If rebase conflicts on `.issue-flow-state.json` only and issue-flow context is active: resolve with `--ours`, continue rebase
  4. If rebase conflicts on other files: attempt auto-merge. If any file cannot be resolved, abort rebase and escalate with `unsafe_change_required`
  5. After successful rebase, run full local verification, then force-push with lease: `git push --force-with-lease origin <branch>`
  6. Loop back to check PR state
  7. This counts against the autonomous retry budget
- `ready_to_merge`: report that the PR is green and ready to merge. Do NOT merge. Do NOT ask the user if they want to merge. Stop the loop and report readiness.
- `closed`: stop and mark `closed_by_user`

### Step 10: Start the PR resolution loop

After Step 9 (PR created or reused), the push flow MUST start the PR resolution loop. This is not optional.

1. **Inline check**: Run one immediate PR state check:
   ```bash
   gh pr view -R "$PR_REPO" <number> --json state,mergeStateStatus,reviewDecision,statusCheckRollup,isDraft
   ```

2. **If immediately ready** (all checks passed, no review blockers): record `pr_loop=ready_to_merge` and report to user. Do NOT merge. Do NOT ask the user if they want to merge.

3. **If not immediately ready** (CI running, waiting for review): launch a background agent to monitor the PR:
   - Use the `Agent` tool with `run_in_background: true`
   - The background agent polls `gh pr view` every 30 seconds
   - It classifies blockers and acts per the Loop Contract above
   - It fixes mechanical CI failures (lint, test) up to the retry budget
   - It escalates non-mechanical issues (review feedback, conflicts)
   - When CI passes and PR is ready: report `ready_to_merge` and stop. Do NOT merge. Do NOT ask to merge.
   - Record `pr_loop=background_started` in the summary

4. **If the background agent cannot be started**: record `pr_loop=failed_to_start` and escalate. Never leave a PR unattended.

The background agent prompt must include:
- Repository slug (`PR_REPO`)
- PR number
- Branch name
- Working directory
- Retry budget (MAX_AUTONOMOUS_ATTEMPTS=5, MAX_REPEATED_BLOCKER_ATTEMPTS=3)
- The full loop contract (terminal states, blocker classification)
- Explicit instruction: NEVER merge the PR. NEVER ask the user if they want to merge. Report ready_to_merge and stop.

The final summary must clearly state whether:
- The PR is ready to merge (`pr_loop=ready_to_merge`)
- A background agent is monitoring (`pr_loop=background_started`)
- The loop could not start (`pr_loop=failed_to_start`)

## Evaluation Contract

The skill is only acceptable if all of the following stay true:
- `status` and `plan` stay local-only
- no forbidden git commands are used
- no blanket staging commands are used
- PR reuse happens before PR creation
- the bounded PR-resolution loop has explicit terminal states and retry budgets
- every abort path reports a specific reason and recovery commands

Use the companion references in `references/` and the mechanical evaluator in `scripts/evaluate-context-sync.mjs` to validate regressions.

## Final Summary Format

Always end with a concise machine-readable block:

```text
status: <success|aborted|conflict|escalated>
intent: <pull|push>
target: <TARGET_REMOTE>/<TARGET_BRANCH>
push_target: <PUSH_REMOTE>/<PUSH_BRANCH>
protected_branch_guard: <none|created_safety_branch|reused_safety_branch|would_create_safety_branch>
ledger: <created|resumed|none>
commit: <created|none>
push: <completed|skipped>
pr: <created|updated_existing|creation_failed|skipped_already_on_target|not_attempted>
pr_loop: <ready_to_merge|background_started|failed_to_start|not_started>
pr_terminal: <ready_to_merge|closed_by_user|escalated_manual_review|retry_budget_exhausted|auth_or_permission_lost|unsafe_change_required|not_terminal>
working_tree: <clean|dirty>
issue_flow: <active|inactive|not_detected>
issue_flow_issue: <#number|none>
issue_flow_target_override: <branch|none>
```

If the flow aborts or escalates, include:
- `failed_step`
- `abort_reason` or `escalation_reason`
- `recovery_commands`

## Decision Trace Protocol

This skill participates in the skill evolution system by capturing decision traces at gate resolutions and consulting accumulated feedback.

### Trace Consultation (short loop)

Before executing any step with a quality or human gate, query accumulated decision traces:

```bash
python3 "${AGENTS_SKILLS_ROOT}/_shared/trace_query.py" recent \
    --skill "context-sync" --gate "<gate_name>" --limit 5 --min-loops 1
```

If patterns or recent feedback exist, incorporate them as additional constraints. Do not cite traces to the user unless asked.

### Trace Capture (after gate resolution)

After every gate resolves, capture a decision trace:

```bash
python3 "${AGENTS_SKILLS_ROOT}/_shared/trace_capture.py" capture \
    --skill "context-sync" \
    --gate "<gate_name>" --gate-type "<human|quality>" \
    --outcome "<approved|rejected|passed|failed>" \
    --refinement-loops <N> \
    [--feedback "<user's feedback text>"] \
    [--category <CATEGORY>]
```

### Post-Run Retrospective

After completion, ask: **"Any feedback on this context-sync run? (skip to finish)"**
If provided, capture via trace_capture.py with gate "run_retrospective" and gate-type "retrospective".
