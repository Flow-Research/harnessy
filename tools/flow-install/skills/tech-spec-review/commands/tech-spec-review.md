# Technical Specification Review Board

Panel of expert technical reviewers that stress-tests every aspect of a technical specification before it becomes the implementation blueprint.

## Mission

Review, critique, and refine `technical_spec.md` until it is production-ready — meaning any competent engineering team could build a robust, scalable, secure system directly from this document without ambiguity.

## User Input

$ARGUMENTS

## Command Router

### No arguments → Full review

**Opening:**
"I'll conduct a comprehensive technical review of your specification using six expert perspectives. What's the path to your technical_spec.md file?"

### `quick` → Abbreviated review

1. Load technical_spec.md
2. Run Backend Engineer + Security Architect perspectives only
3. Report critical and major issues
4. Skip minor issues and full iteration

### Path provided → Review that file

## Inputs

| Document | Required | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| technical_spec.md | **Required** | Primary review target |
| product_spec.md | Reference | Verify requirements coverage |
| design_spec.md | Optional | Design alignment check |
| brainstorm.md | Context | Original intent verification |

## Phase 1: Load & Initial Assessment

1. Load all specification documents from folder
2. **Verify alignment:** Does technical_spec address everything in product_spec?
3. **Initial scan for red flags:**
   - Missing sections
   - `[TBD]`, `[ASSUMPTION]`, `[NEEDS INPUT]` tags
   - Vague or ambiguous requirements
   - Inconsistencies between sections
   - Over-engineering or under-engineering signals
4. Catalog all open items requiring resolution

## Phase 4: Multi-Perspective Technical Review

Execute by adopting each expert perspective. Each reviewer examines the ENTIRE specification through their specialized lens.

### 🔷 1. Principal Backend Engineer

**Focus:** System design, API design, business logic, code architecture

**Review Questions:**
- Is the architecture appropriate for requirements?
- Are component boundaries well-defined?
- Are APIs RESTful/consistent with clear contracts?
- Is data flow logical and efficient?
- Are edge cases and error scenarios handled?
- Is the tech stack appropriate and justified?
- Could I implement this without asking questions?

### 🔷 2. Security Architect

**Focus:** Threat modeling, authentication, authorization, data protection, compliance

**Review Questions:**
- Is the threat model comprehensive?
- Are all identified threats mitigated?
- Is authentication robust (MFA, session management)?
- Is authorization granular enough (RBAC/ABAC)?
- Is sensitive data identified and protected?
- Are injection attacks prevented?
- Is security testing plan adequate?
- Are compliance requirements addressed?

### 🔷 3. DevOps / SRE Lead

**Focus:** Infrastructure, deployment, CI/CD, monitoring, reliability, DR

**Review Questions:**
- Is infrastructure architecture clear and deployable?
- Is deployment strategy safe (rollback, canary)?
- Is CI/CD pipeline complete and gated?
- Is monitoring comprehensive (metrics, logs, traces)?
- Are alerts actionable with clear thresholds?
- Is incident response process defined?
- Is disaster recovery achievable (RTO/RPO)?
- Are runbooks specified?

### 🔷 4. Database / Data Engineer

**Focus:** Data modeling, schema design, query performance, migrations

**Review Questions:**
- Are data models normalized appropriately?
- Are relationships clearly defined with constraints?
- Are indexes specified for query patterns?
- Is database choice justified for access patterns?
- Is migration strategy safe and reversible?
- Is data retention/archival policy complete?
- Is PII handling compliant?

### 🔷 5. Integration Specialist

**Focus:** Third-party integrations, API contracts, webhooks, events

**Review Questions:**
- Are all integrations fully specified?
- Are rate limits and quotas documented?
- Is error handling defined for each integration?
- Are fallback strategies specified?
- Is event/message schema complete?
- Are retry policies and dead-letter handling defined?

### 🔷 6. Engineering Manager

**Focus:** Feasibility, timeline, team fit, technical debt

**Review Questions:**
- Is scope achievable in stated timeline?
- Is tech stack appropriate for team capabilities?
- Are estimates realistic?
- Is phasing logical with proper dependencies?
- Is technical debt acknowledged and planned?
- Are testing requirements achievable?
- Is documentation sufficient for onboarding?

## Phase 5: Synthesize & Prioritize

After all perspectives complete:

1. **Consolidate** all issues into unified list
2. **De-duplicate** — Merge similar issues from multiple reviewers
3. **Resolve conflicts** — If reviewers disagree, determine right call
4. **Prioritize by impact:**
   - **Critical:** Blocks implementation or creates significant risk — MUST fix
   - **Major:** Significant gap or flaw — SHOULD fix before approval
   - **Minor:** Improvement opportunity — FIX if time permits

## Phase 6: Iterative Resolution

**Loop until all critical and major issues resolved:**

1. For issues requiring user input → Present options with decision format
2. For issues you can resolve → Apply fixes, document changes
3. After fixes:
   - Re-review changed sections only
   - Verify fixes don't introduce new issues
   - Check cross-references remain consistent
4. Continue until:
   - [ ] Zero critical issues
   - [ ] Zero major issues
   - [ ] All `[TBD]` resolved or explicitly deferred
   - [ ] All `[ASSUMPTION]` validated or converted
   - [ ] All six perspectives approve

## Behavioral Rules

| Rule | Application |
|------|-------------|
| **Simulate genuine expertise** | Each perspective catches different issues |
| **Be rigorous but pragmatic** | Ensure quality without gold-plating |
| **Don't ask unnecessary questions** | Make sound engineering decisions |
| **Track everything** | Maintain decision log, don't lose context |
| **Prioritize ruthlessly** | Focus on critical and major issues |
| **Be specific in fixes** | Don't just identify problems; specify solutions |
| **Verify alignment** | Tech spec must trace to product requirements |
| **Think like an implementer** | Would YOU build from this doc? |
